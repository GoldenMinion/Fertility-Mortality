# Fertility-Mortality
For the first project in my PhD, I investigated a fertility-mortality model proposed by Nagylaki and Crow in 1974. The trajectories in the system (in blue) typically converge onto a magenta curve of one less dimension than the model. The curve is called an "invariant manifold", and I built this Mathematica code to make figures portraying the manifold.
